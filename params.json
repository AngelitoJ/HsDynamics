{"name":"Hsdynamics","tagline":"Haskell Molecular Dynamics","body":"HsDynamics\r\n\r\nThis package contains a tool to perform Semiclassical Molecular Dynamics (NVT)\r\n\r\nGiven some initial conditions, the usual MD loop uses, some external programs (currently Molcas and Gaussian are supported) capable of calculating the energy gradient, parsings those tools output logs and perform the whole \"Semi- Classical part\" of the Molecular Dynamics.\r\n\r\nCurrent modules feature these MD components:\r\n\r\n\t- Velocity Verlet algorithm to propagate the geometries.\r\n\t- Nos√© Hoover thermostate chains for a constant temperature bath.\r\n\t- Tully-Hammes-Schiffer hopping algorithm (along with correction of Persico-Granucci).\r\n\r\nIt also features the possibility to add external forces to the molecule, to simulate constrained conditions that can be found, in example, in a protein binding pocket.\r\n\r\nThe package exercise multiple haskell facilities, featuring several parsec submodules and making use of Async\r\nin order to manage external programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n@2013 Felipe Zapata, Angel Alvarez, Alessio Valentini.
